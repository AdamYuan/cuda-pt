/**
 * (W)ave(f)ront (S)imple path tracing with stream multiprocessing
 * We first consider how to make a WF tracer, then we start optimizing it, hence this is a 'Simple' one 
 * 
 * for each stream, we will create their own ray pools for
 * stream compaction and possible execution reordering
 * 
 * each stream contains 4 * 4 blocks, each block contains 16 * 16 threads, which is therefore
 * a 64 * 64 pixel patch. We will only create at most 8 streams, to fill up the host-device connections
 * therefore, it is recommended that the image sizes are the multiple of 64
 * 
 * for each kernel function, sx (int) and sy (int) are given, which is the base location of the current
 * stream. For example, let there be 4 streams and 4 kernel calls and the image is of size (256, 256)
 * stream 1: (0, 0), (64, 0), (128, 0), (192, 0)                |  1   2   3   4  |
 * stream 2: (0, 64), (64, 64), (128, 64), (192, 64)            |  1   2   3   4  |
 * stream 3: (0, 128), (64, 128), (128, 128), (192, 128)        |  1   2   3   4  |
 * stream 4: (0, 192), (64, 192), (128, 192), (192, 192)        |  1   2   3   4  |
